This is a collection of design files for mounting brackets for hobby servo motors.

The brackets were modeled in and the STL files were generated using OpenSCAD.  http://openscad.org

The servo_bracket_modules.scad file contains re-usable code.

The goal is to make parts that can be printed on a MakerBot or other RepRaps.  http://makerbot.com

For an idea of what I'm going for see: http://www.trossenrobotics.com/c/hobby-servos-for-robotics.aspx
